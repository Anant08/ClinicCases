ClinicCases 6 changelog

Rev??? ??/??/2010

New Features

*	A single student can now be assigned to two or more professors
*	Journals can now be submitted to more than one professor
*	An unlimited number of professors and students can work on a single case.
*	Ability to easily message everybody working on a given case added.
*	Students page improved to show at a glance which students are on a case and to easily unassign a student

Bugfixes

*	If user cancels entering in a new case, the case number is now deleted and can be re-used.

TO DO

* Need two packages: one for install, one for upgrade.  Upgrade package will leave Docs and People folders alone and will also include upgrade script.

* New directory structure for documents docs>[date]>[username].  Script will move pre-cc6 documents to a pre-cc6 directory.  This structure will go for docs as well as board attachments.  Gets rid of need to change file name.  If you did this by time [or unique folder name] as well, might be able to introduce versioning.

* Google Docs and Dropbox integration.

* Use Google Docs viewer to preview docs? [security?]. This would be nice with versioning feature.

* First view prof sees is left column student > cases working on > last activity.  Then can switch to cases>students>assign
