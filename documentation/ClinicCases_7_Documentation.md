## Getting Started
ClinicCases is a web-based case management system designed specifically for law school clinics. It is designed to be easy-to-use with a minimal learning curve.

Once your ClinicCases is installed on your server (see [Installation](#install)), here's how to get started.  CC ships with three pre-defined user groups: Administrators, Professors, and Students.  These groups can be [customized](#customization).  You should log in using the default administrator account:

* Username: admin
* Password: admin

You will then be prompted to change your password.  Once that is done, click on the Users tab.  You should see that there is only one active user, Temp Admin.  You should add at least one new administrative user by clicking on New User in the upper-right hand corner.

Be sure to include your email address in the new user information.  Check to see if your mail server is working and then check your email for an email with a temporary password to the new account.  Log on to CC with these credentials and then [change your password](#change_password).  You can now delete the Temp Admin account by going to Users, opening Temp Admin and pressing delete.
